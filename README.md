**Introduction**

Yelp is a well-known online platform where users can find, review, and rate local businesses such as restaurants, salons, and service providers. It provides detailed business information, customer reviews, and photos. To support research and learning, Yelp offers an Open Dataset — a subset of real user-generated data — for use in academic and data science projects. This dataset includes business attributes, user reviews, check-ins, and more, making it an excellent resource for analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing tasks. https://www.yelp.com/dataset
